/**
 * Initial file to do familiarize everyone with git.
 * Please do the following:
 * - Create a new Java class, which replicates this file
 * 	-	Name the file "HelloWorld[YOUR_LAST_NAME].java (for me it would be HelloWorldNguyen.java
 * - Replace the text "Hello world!" with "Hello [your name]!" (for me it would be "Hello Don 
 * 	 Nguyen!"
 * - Push your changes to git
 * 	-	For first exercise, working on the master branch is fine. Moving forward, please add all
 * 		changes on feature/fix branches (we will discuss this once we get to this point)
